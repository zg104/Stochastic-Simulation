# Stochastic-Simulation

## Here are several perceptions and concepts of stochastic simulation.

When we are told to solve a high dimensional data with a lot of features. 
We try to calculate something analytically with the full parameterization of 2^n.

So, how can we lower the parameters?

- x = (x1,x2,...,xn) --> multi-normal
- Markov Chain
- Mixture models
- graphical models (undirected, DAGS)
- hardcore models
- Gaussian process
- Hiden Markov Models (HMM)

Given the model, how can we deal with the problem from the perspective of probability?

- computing probabilities of random vectors which involves high dimensional intergrals.
